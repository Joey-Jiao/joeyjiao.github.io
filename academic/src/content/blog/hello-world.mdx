This is the inaugural post on my blog. I built this using **MDX** with SolidJS, which lets me mix Markdown with interactive components.

## Code Highlighting

Here's an example of syntax-highlighted code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class GNNLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_dim, out_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_dim, out_dim)

    def forward(self, x, adj):
        return torch.relu(self.linear(adj @ x))
```

## Math Formulas

The message-passing framework in GNNs can be expressed as:

$$
h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(W^{(l)} \cdot \text{AGG}\left(\{h_u^{(l)} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\right)\right)
$$

Where $h_v^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $v$ at layer $l$, and $\mathcal{N}(v)$ denotes the neighborhood of $v$.
